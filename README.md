# BUBBLESORT
This is a c++ code which contains a sorting algorithm called Bubble Sort

# Optimizations performed
The inner loop has been optimized such that with each pass of the outer loop, the number of items to be swapped decreases
The code also contains a boolean that tracks the swapped items. This makes to break out of the nested loop earlier if no swaps were made
